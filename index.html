        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Jon Beveridge, and I was born on the 6<sup>th</sup> of December. I decided to take the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">I.M.D."</abbr> program to have a change of career. 
        For the past ten years I've been working in the Ottawa area as a musician and specifically as a drummer. 
        Music has been a passion of mine since I was 14 but I decided I wanted a new challenge.</p>

        My brother had always directed me towards UX/UI design since he is a designer himself so I decided that it would be an
        interesting career path to take! I've always wanted to work more on the tech side and I think that this will be the perfect
        opportunity so further myself and the career I would like to have.</p>
